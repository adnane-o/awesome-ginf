Hello there!, I made this repository as a request from some students at school [ENSAT](http://ensat.ac.ma) in order to help them wisely choose an engineering branch that suits and fits their desires and skills, they are about to choose from 5 branches, which are : 

+ **GSTR** : Telecomunication & Networking Engineering
+ **GIND** : Industrial & Logistics Engineering
+ **GINF** : Computer Science
+ **GSEA** : Electronic & Automatics Engineering 
+ **G3EI** : Eco-Energy & Industrial Environment Engineering 

> you can find a full description of these branches at our offical  ~~shitty~~ [website](http://ensat.ac.ma) :poop:

I need to mention that even if the language used to teach at our school is French, which is I consider bad, English stays the main go to langage to study and learn Computer Science, so friends, you need to get familiar! => first rule of Computer Science!

Clearly I'm gonna be talking only about **Computer Science**, and since there's a lot to cover, I'll be deviding this content into sections, each section will be contained on it separate file included in this same repository, that way we can have a better and organised ressources, let's start.

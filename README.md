![GINF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zianwar/awesome-ginf/master/images/ginf.png?token=AGMZeFbP2EnVs2S29E2B4NdXZpn19lu6ks5VqvTTwA%3D%3D "Génie Informatique")            

Hello there!, I made this repository as a request from some students school [ENSAT](http://ensat.ac.ma) in order to help them wisely choose an engineering branch that suits and fits their desires and skills, they are about to choose from 5 branches, which are : 

+ **GSTR** : Telecomunication & Networking Engineering
+ **GIND** : Industrial & Logistics Engineering
+ **GINF** : Computer Science
+ **GSEA** : Electronic & Automatics Engineering 
+ **G3EI** : Eco-Energy & Industrial Environment Engineering 

> you can find a full description of these branches at our offical  ~~shitty~~ [website](http://ensat.ac.ma)

I need to mention that even if language used to teach computer science at our school is French, which is I consider bad, English stays the main CS langages so friend you need to get familiar, first rule of Computer Science!
Clearly I'm gonna be talking only about **Computer Science**, and since there's a looooot to cover, I'll be deviding this content into sections, each section will be contained on it separate file included in this same repository. 

Puisque'il y a beaucoup de chose à dire, nous allons structurer le contenu par plusieurs parties chaque partie va être dans son propre fichier `.md` sera contenu dans la même `repository`.

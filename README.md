Hello there!, I made this repository as a request from some students at our school [ENSAT](http://ensat.ac.ma) in order to help them wisely choose an engineering branch that suits and fits their desires and skills, they are about to choose from 5 branches, which are : 

+ **GSTR** : Telecomunication & Networking Engineering
+ **GIND** : Industrial & Logistics Engineering
+ **GINF** : Computer Science
+ **GSEA** : Electronic & Automatics Engineering 
+ **G3EI** : Eco-Energy & Industrial Environment Engineering 

> you can find a full description of these branches at our offical  ~~shitty~~ [website](http://ensat.ac.ma) :poop:

I need to mention that even if the language used to teach at our school is French, which I consider bad, English stays the main go to language to study and learn Computer Science, so friends, you need to get familiar with it! => first rule of Computer Science!

Clearly I'm gonna be talking only about **Computer Science**, and since there's a lot to cover, I'll be dividing this content into sections, each section will contain its own content, this way we can have better and more organised ressources.
